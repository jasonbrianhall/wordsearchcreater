This program creates Word Search Puzzles using an input text file and creates MS-Word Documents with the words

pip install -r requirements.txt
./wordsearch.py -i inputfilename -o outputfilename.docx -s size

Size can't be too small or it creates an infinite loop (so be aware); the smallest size for the example file that works is 23
